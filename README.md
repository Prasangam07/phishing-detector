🛠️ How to Use
Basic Usage

View Results: See the security analysis and risk assessment

Preview Content: Examine the simulated website preview

Example URLs to Test
Safe URLs (for testing safe results):

https://example.com

https://google.com

https://github.com

Suspicious URLs (for testing warning/danger results):

http://secure-paypal-login.com

https://facebook-verify-account.net

http://amazon-security-update.xyz

🔍 How It Works
Detection Algorithm
The application uses multiple heuristics to assess URL safety:

HTTPS Verification: Checks for secure connections

Suspicious Keywords: Identifies common phishing terms

Domain Analysis: Examines URL structure and patterns

Known Threat Database: Compares against simulated blacklists

Risk Levels
🟢 Safe: Legitimate website with proper security measures

🟡 Warning: Potential security concerns detected

🔴 Danger: High probability of phishing attempt

🎨 Customization
Modifying Colors
Edit the CSS variables in style.css:

css
:root {
    --primary: #4361ee;
    --secondary: #3a0ca3;
    --success: #4cc9f0;
    --warning: #f72585;
    /* Add your custom colors here */
}
Adding Detection Rules
Extend the detection logic in script.js:

javascript
// Add new suspicious patterns
const newSuspiciousPatterns = [
    'free-bitcoin',
    'crypto-reward',
    'bank-verification'
];
